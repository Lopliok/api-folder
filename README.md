Hereâ€™s a basic README.md template for running an Express.js app in English:

```markdown
# Express.js App

This project is a simple application built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/), designed as a foundation for web servers and RESTful APIs.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 14 or higher 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

Recommended - Node 18.12.0


## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. **Build frontend**:

   In the app directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm build
   ```

3. **Install dependencies of api**:

   In the project directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server**:

   To start the server in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```


   By default, the app will run on `http://localhost:3000`, but you can change this by setting the `PORT` variable in `.env`.
